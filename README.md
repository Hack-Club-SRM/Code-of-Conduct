Realize that the members of the Community hail from different parts of the Country. Value diverse cultures, views and thoughts. We expect you to be respectful at all times, even when you are in disagreement with others around you. Misbehaviour, prejudice and xenophobia will not be tolerated at any event, remote or offline, organized by or in association with Hack Club SRM.

### Encourage Inclusivity
Reiterating on the aforementioned pointer, make sure that you encourage others around you to participate in healthy discussions in the Community. Interact with those around you and facilitate participation. Respect equality and opportunity for all. Try to assist those who are facing challenges in participating in discussions and events. Take stand for individuals affected in case anyone is found indulging in misbehaviour. 

### Don't Harass
At Hack Club SRM, **harassment in any form will not be tolerated** and will be dealt with sternly.

If you are making anybody uncomfortable with your actions after them denying consent, the same will be counted as harassment.
Members asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Failure in doing so will result in immediate dismissal from Hack Club SRM and the Core Team will not refrain from notifying authorities and officials of the University.
Use of harmful language is absolutely prohibited in the Community.

**If you are unsure whether your action will be counted as harassment or not, simply avoid indulging in it.**

### Don't Disrupt
Sustained disruption of events organized by the team and meetings will not be tolerated. This does not count if a participant is unwell or uncomfortable or is being harassed by another participant and in such cases we guarantee resolution immediately. The same is on the condition that it does not make others uncomfortable and the participant conveys their discomfort politely.
Behaviour that will be counted as disruption is as follows:
  - ‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers or participants indulging in discussion.
  - Influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session.
  - Passing derogatory or demotivating comments to pester the speakers or participants indulging in discussion.

**Possession or consumption of alcohol or other intoxicants at offline events organized by Hack Club SRM is strictly prohibited and is a punishable offense on Campus.**
